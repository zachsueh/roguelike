# Essay Hunt

This is a 2D roguelike dungeon-themed game designed using the Unity game engine, which I completed as a team with eight others. This repository includes documentation, a user manual, an installation guide, a maintenance guide, and the game itself. Many of these files contain our team name which was Team Olive. We were a SCRUM team, and my role was the lead of the development team as I had the most experience with Unity.


## Game Story

The game begins with a student working on an essay assignment at home. They go to bed and and awake in the morning to find their essay gone. You’re the student, trapped in a library and you’re trying to escape! The library has come alive and you’re trying to find a way out. Pages of the essay you were writing before bed last night seem to be scattered throughout the library; could this be a nightmare?


## Installation
For installation instructions please read the 'Installation Guide.pdf' file.

## Maintenance
The maintenance guide ('Maintenance Guide.pdf') can be found in the Documentation folder, and contains useful tips for downloading and getting started with Unity, in addition to important information about all the classes and scripts used in the game. This folder also contains all of the files for the complete Unity project which can be downloaded and modified by you.
